        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Palmer Kane Design is a small, local business offering
            many services including custom formal and bridal,
            alterations, mending, and childrens couture. This Website
            will serve as a hub for clients to gain valuable service information
            and get their project started with Palmer Kane Design.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Female, young in their 20s or 30s. Women planning events (weddings, dances, banquets). These women may know
            exactly what they want and they would like to get figures on expenses up front. Some may not know exactly
            what they need, so the service descriptions and quoting form will be important to them. Planning events or
            getting ready for them can be stressful so the audience needs to know that Palmer Kane Design will be there
            for them. </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Dawning Of A New Day</h4>
        <p>This font captures the hand made feel of a seamstress shop and adds a little bit of class to the Titles and
            Headings.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Crimson Text</h4>
        <p>This font is very legible and this is needed for the bulk of the writing since the purpose of the writing is
            to be read.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph example</h4>
        <p>Once there was a silly little girl who went frolicking through the woods without a care in the world. While
            running through a clearing she met a rabbit who warned her about the wolf that roamed the neighboring
            meadows. She dismissed the rabits warning and continued on her way.</p>

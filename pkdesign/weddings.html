                of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In
                reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A
                paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
                Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For
                instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
                sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.
                In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in
                the rest of the paragraph.</p>

            <p class="wp1"> Alterations<br><br>If you've already found the perfect dress but it's not the perfect fit,
                Palmer Kane Design can finish the job. Alterations are not just for new dresses, we can upscale your
                heirloom dress to fit you like a dream. Alterations are also not just for apparel. Used wedding gowns may 
                be converted into throw pillows, baby blankets, table runners, christening gowns, and so much more. </p>
            <p class="wp2"> Custom Work<br><br>If you are having trouble finding the perfect look, fit, or feel then we can 
                design, draft, and create something that suits your every need. This service is not only good for brides and 
                bridal parties but for grooms and groomsmen as well. Custom decor items such as embroidered napkins, table runners,
                or chair covers are available upon request. </p>
            <p class="wp3"> Wedding Rentals<br><br>Wedding dress rentals are available as a cost saving alternitive to purchasing a 
                dress. Dress rental fee includes the cost of cleaning, but not alterations. Other rental items available are tables,
                 chairs, linens, table decor, and all the themed room decorations you can imagine.</p>

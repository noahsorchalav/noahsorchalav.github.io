                        <strong>Main Fork of Salmon River, Idaho</strong><br>
                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                        given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of
                        the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river
                        that they never left.

                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                        also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
                        tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                        undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and
                        colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good
                        rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late
                        summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                        <strong>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</strong><br>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green
                        river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful
                        desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from
                        Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,
                        interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
                        whitewater opportunities.

                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                        uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                        <strong>Grand Canyon, Arizona</strong><br><br>
                        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never
                        forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                        truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                        rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                        technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
                        variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we
                        often refer to both.</p>
